# DSA-Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of various **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. The aim of this project is to showcase and enhance my understanding of both **linear** and **non-linear** data structures and their related algorithms. Each implementation includes associated problem-solving exercises to demonstrate the practical application of these data structures.

## Data Structures

### Linear Data Structures
1. **Linked Lists**
   - **Singly Linked List**: Implementation of a singly linked list with common operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
   - **Doubly Linked List**: Doubly linked list where each node points to both its previous and next node.
   - **Circular Linked List**: Circular variant where the last node links back to the first node.
   
2. **Stacks**
   - **Array-based Stack**: Stack implementation using arrays.
   - **Linked List-based Stack**: Stack implemented using a linked list.
   
3. **Queues**
   - **ArrayQueue**: Standard queue implemented using an array.
   - **LinkedListQueue**: Queue implementation using linked lists.
   - **PriorityQueue**: Priority queue using a heap structure.
   - **TwoStackQueue**: Queue implemented using two stacks.
   
4. **HashMaps**
   - **HashMap using Chaining**: Collision resolution through linked lists (chaining).
   - **HashMap using Linear Probing**: Open addressing technique to resolve collisions via linear probing.

### Non-Linear Data Structures
1. **Trees**
   - **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Implementation of a binary search tree with common operations (insert, search, delete).
   - **AVL Tree**: Self-balancing binary search tree.
   - **Heap**: Min-heap and max-heap implementations.
   
2. **Graphs**
   - **Graph Representation**: Graph implemented using adjacency lists and matrices.
   - **Graph Traversal Algorithms**: BFS (Breadth-First Search) and DFS (Depth-First Search) implementations.
